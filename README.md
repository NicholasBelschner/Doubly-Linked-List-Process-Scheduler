# Doubly-Linked-List-Process-Scheduler
Reads data from a file, stores the numbers (arrival time and burst time) in a doubly linked list, 
sorts the list using either the First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) or Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm, 
calculates waiting time and turnaround time, and prints the sorted list and the calculated values.

My program stores numbers from a file that is scanned from command line.
The two numbers that are being stored is the arrival time and burst time.
I used a doubly linked list to store these two numbers together.
While keeping the two numbers together I used bubble sort.
I created a function that has the purpose of showing the sorted processes,
calculating the average burst time and arrival time.
